# Mern-Stack Backend

## Running the Application

To run the backend application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have MongoDB and Bun installed and running on your machine.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend project and set the `MONGO_URI` variable to the connection string of your MongoDB database.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend project directory.
4. Run `bun i` to install the project dependencies.
5. Run `bun run start` to start the backend server.

The backend server will start running on the specified port, and you can access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or by integrating it with a frontend application.
